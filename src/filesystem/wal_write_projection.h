  ///     b) Allocate a log segment bigger than the largest possible payload

  /// We chose (b) explicitly. If you look at the history of commits, you will

  /// Usability Note: We use a write-behind queue as we are bypassing the kernel
  /// page cache.  The default size is seastar's default 'write-behind' cache of
  /// 1MB. That means that even after you write, your reads will *not* always be

  /// the readers also implement a sophisticated cache with intelligent eviction
  /// schemes, but you must cache the write-behind
